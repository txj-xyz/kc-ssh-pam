# Keycloak SSH PAM

**kc-ssh-pam** designed to streamline the process of user authentication and enable users to access Linux systems through SSH. The program integrates with Keycloak to obtain a password grant token based on the user's login credentials, including their username and password. If two-factor authentication is enabled for the user, the program supports OTP code as well.

Once the password grant token is obtained, the program verifies it and passes the necessary parameters so that the user can be authenticated via SSH and access the Linux systems.

## Install

<details>
    <summary>DEB & RPM</summary>

```bash

sudo dpkg -i kc-ssh-pam_amd64.deb

# RPM
sudo rpm -i kc-ssh-pam_amd64.rpm

```

```bash
# Chose desired version
export KC_SSH_PAM_VERSION="0.1.2"
wget -q https://github.com/kha7iq/kc-ssh-pam/releases/download/v${KC_SSH_PAM_VERSION}/kc-ssh-pam_linux_amd64.tar.gz && \
tar -xf kc-ssh-pam_linux_amd64.tar.gz && \
chmod +x kc-ssh-pam && \
sudo mkdir -p /opt/kc-ssh-pam && \
sudo mv kc-ssh-pam config.toml /opt/kc-ssh-pam
```
</details>


## Usage
```bash
❯ kc-ssh-pam --help
Usage: kc-ssh-pam USERNAME PASSWORD/[OTP]

Generates a password grant token from Keycloak for the given user.

Options:
  -h, --help              Show this help message and exit
  -v, --version           Show version information
  -c                      Set configuration file path

Notes:
  For the program to function properly, it needs to locate a configuration file called 'config.toml'.
  The program will search for this file in the current directory, '/opt/kc-ssh-pam' and '$HOME/.config/config.toml',
  in that specific order. You can also set a custom path by specifying KC_SSH_CONFIG variable or -c flag which takes prefrence.

  In addition to defaults, all configuration parameters can also be provided through environment variables.

  KC_SSH_CONFIG KC_SSH_REALM KC_SSH_ENDPOINT KC_SSH_CLIENTID KC_SSH_CLIENTSECRET KC_SSH_CLIENTSCOPE
  
  To use the program, you must create a client in Keycloak and provide the following 
  information in the configuration file: realm, endpoint, client ID, client secret, and 
  client scope is optional.

Arguments:
  USERNAME                The username of the user is taken from $PAM_USER environment variable
  PASSWORD                The password of the user is taken from stdIn
  OTP                     (Optional) The OTP code if two-factor authentication is enabled i.e (password/otp)

  EXAMPLE                 (With otp): echo testpass/717912 | kc-ssh-pam (Only Password): echo testpass | kc-ssh-pam

```

## Configuration
  For the program to function properly, it needs to locate a configuration file called `config.toml`.
  
  The program will search for this file in the follwoing order..
  1. If a config path is specified using the `-c` flag, it will override any other defined options.
  2. Verify the existence of the KC_SSH_CONFIG variable; if it's defined, use the location specified within it.
  3. The working directory where the program is being executed from.
  4. Default install location `/opt/kc-ssh-pam/`
  5. `$HOME/.config/`
  
  
`config.toml`
  ```
realm = "ssh-demo"
endpoint = "https://keycloak.example.com"
clientid = "keycloak-client-id"
clientsecret = "MIKEcHObWmI3V3pF1hcSqC9KEILfLN"
clientscope = "openid"

  ```
* Edit `/etc/pam.d/sshd` and add the following at the top of file
```bash
auth sufficient pam_exec.so expose_authtok      log=/var/log/kc-ssh-pam.log     /opt/kc-ssh-pam/kc-ssh-pam
```
- User is not automatically created during login, so a local user must be present on the system before hand.

To automatically create a user install 
```bash
 apt-get install libpam-script
```
Add the follwoing in `/etc/pam.d/sshd` underneath previous argument
```bash
auth optional pam_script.so
```

Then, the script itself. In the file `/usr/share/libpam-script/pam_script_auth`
```bash
#!/bin/bash
adduser $PAM_USER --disabled-password --quiet --gecos ""
```
In PAM modules, username is given in "$PAM_USER" variable.

Make this script executable
```bash
chmod +x /usr/share/libpam-script/pam_script_auth 
```
Restart sshd service
```bash
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```
